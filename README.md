# Veterinary Clinic Information Management and Registration System with PyQt5, SQLAlchemy, and SQLite
## Description:
The project presents the development of a management system for a veterinary clinic,
encompassing the administration of data related to owners, animals, appointments,
vaccinations, veterinarians, and species. This system is the result of an applied study aimed at
creating a practical solution for performing CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) operations
on all the involved entities. The main objective of the project is to provide a tool that facilitates
the control of important information, such as the names, addresses, and contact numbers of pet
owners, as well as the data related to the animals themselves and the responsible veterinarians.

The methodology used includes the implementation of a SQLite database, integrated into the
system through an object-relational mapping (ORM) using the SQLAlchemy library.
Additionally, a graphical interface was developed with PyQt5, allowing for a more intuitive
and accessible user interaction.

With the interface, functionalities were implemented that allow users to easily select the records
of owners and their respective animals, making the querying, updating, and deleting of data
more efficient. The system, which offers an integrated and efficient management of the different
entities, represents a robust and practical foundation, with the potential to enhance data
management in the veterinary clinic.
